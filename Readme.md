# Word Counter Project

This is a simple Python program that counts the number of words in a given text. The project is designed to strengthen the understanding and application of Python programming concepts.

## Project Overview
As part of your Python Programming Internship, your Week 2 project will be centered around creating a "Word Counter" program. This project is designed to strengthen your understanding and application of Python programming concepts. The task involves creating a simple program that counts the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph.

## Project Objectives
- **Understanding Input Handling**: Learn how to take user input in Python.
- **String Manipulation**: Explore string manipulation techniques for text processing.
- **Function Creation**: Practice creating functions in Python for modular code.
- **Basic Control Flow**: Implement basic control flow structures to control the program's logic.
- **Output Display**: Display the word count as the output of the program.

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompt the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.
- **Word Counting Logic**: Implement a function that counts the number of words in the input.
- **Output Display**: Print the word count to the console.
- **Error Handling**: Account for potential errors, such as empty input.
- **Code Comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure a clear and user-friendly interface for input and output.
